## Clangd setup

In order to have proper intellisense, you need to generate the `compile_commands.json` config for [clangd](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html):

```sh
make clean; bear -- make
```

## Building

Pretty straightforward:

```sh
make all
```

## Running tests

Will probably fail

```sh
make test
```
